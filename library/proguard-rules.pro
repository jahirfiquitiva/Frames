# Consumer rules: applied to every app that depends on Frames.
# Only keep what R8 cannot trace by itself. Everything an app calls, extends,
# or declares in its manifest or layouts is kept automatically, and libraries
# (Room, Billing, Material, ...) bundle their own rules.
# Frames reads nothing by reflection, so it needs no rules of its own.
